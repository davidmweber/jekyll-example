          <h1>codeX runs on project-driven learning.</h1>
          <p>That means we combine technical skills, industry orientation and agile practices together, in the context of real projects you build that end up on the Internet for the world to see. Which means you leave codeX with a portfolio of real work.</p>
          <p>Because there’s so much to learn, our curriculum expands and contracts at each person’s individual pace. Some people move swiftly through the basics, some take more time.</p>
          <p>The important thing is that you get comfortable with BOTH the concepts AND their application.</p>
          <p>Once you’ve made your way through the foundations in Release 1, find what you love for Release 2, and then apply again in a deeper context for Release 3. From there, you’ll start to work on real projects with real companies, and maybe even get hired by them.</p>
          <p>The course runs over three 3-month terms, with a Demo Day at the end of each, where you’ll demo what you and your team have developed to that point.</p>

          <h2><b>Epic 1: Programming basics</b></h2>
          <p>Let’s begin.</p>
          <h3><b>Tech Learning</b></h3>
          <p><b>Computer Literacy for Coders</b><br />
            Set up your Ubuntu desktop, navigate your file system, meet the terminal, and start writing commands.<br />
            <b>Version Control</b><br />
            Get to grips with the fundamentals of source control using GitHub. Then see what happens when you clone, pull and push.<br />
            <b>Programming Fundamentals</b><br />
            A few concepts go a long way. Code to count, sort and display your data. And know how to test that your functions are functioning, using QUnit and Travis CI.<br />
            <b>HTML, CSS &amp; Bootstrap</b><br />
            Put your stuff out there. Get it on the web … and make sure it looks great on a laptop, tablet and your mobile.
          </p>
          <h3><b>Agile Learning</b></h3>
          <p>Agility is about responding quickly to change – which means all parts must work well together. We look at the Scrum values, what makes great teams, and how to continuously improve your projects and your learning process.<br />
            <b>Personal Kanban</b><br />
            Get familiar with how to visualize your work and stay focused by limiting work in progress.<br />
            <b>Scrum 1</b><br />
            Daily standups, demos and retrospectives help us stay focused on what’s important and how we can be even better tomorrow.
          </p>
          <h3><b>Industry Orientation</b></h3>
          <p>Coders don’t operate in isolation – and neither does codeX. Industry experts and mentors are always coming through the office, sharing their wisdom on a variety of subjects including:<br />
            <b>Social Media</b><br />
            Our social media workshop gives you practical insights from industry pros to build your online presence on Facebook, Twitter, G+, and more.<br />
            <b>Research</b><br />
            Chances are, that piece of code that you just can’t get to work for you has stumped someone else before too. Our developer mentors help you learn to use Google and <a href="https://href.li/?http://stackoverflow.com/" rel="noreferrer">Stack Overflow</a> to find the answers you need fast and build your coder profile.<br />
            <b>Storytelling</b><br />
            You’ve built your product, now you’ve got to sell it to the world. Why does this app solve a major market failure in the industry? How can a user improve their purchasing with your data visualization tool? Learn how to tell the right story to the right audience for your code with sales and marketing experts.<br />

          </p>
          <h2><b>Epic 2: Scrum Developer</b></h2>
          <p>With the foundation in place, you start working in teams on projects.</p>
          <h3><b>Tech Learning</b></h3>
          <p><b>Programming Basics</b><br />
            Coding is more than just counting and displaying information – we want to interpret it. Go deeper into functions and objects. And then you’ll meet JQuery and the DOM, who help us choose what we want to display.<br />
            <b>Test Driven Development</b><br />
            Make friends with QUnit and Travis CI – these are the guys you need around when times get tough. Write the right tests up front, and save hours on debugging later.<br />
            <b>Databases</b><br />
            Where does data go? Learn the basics of database administration and SQL scripts, to make sure you know where yours is when you’re looking for it.<br />
            <b>Basic Web CRUD</b><br />
            Interpreting, testing, saving all your data. Now bring it to life onscreen.
          </p>
          <h3><b>Agile Learning</b></h3>
          <p>You can visualize work, and limit work in progress. Now start working in a Scrum team, the most common process for agile teams. Add story maps, user stories and sprint burndowns to your toolset.<br />
            <b>Scrum 2</b><br />
            Personas, story maps and prototypes make sure you’re building the right thing for the right people. Standups, demos and retros continue as normal, and you’ll get familiar with team planning, sprint backlogs and burndowns.
          </p>
          <h3><b>Industry Orientation</b></h3>
          <p>Continued visits from industry experts.<br />
            <b>Sales and Marketing</b><br />
            How do you go about talking to users, clients, customers about your awesome app or site? Concrete practical advice from industry practitioners who do it every day.<a name="Epic3"></a><br />

          </p>
          <h2><b>Epic 3: Programming everywhere</b></h2>
          <p>Broaden your sights. In this epic we apply the basics you’ve learned in a variety of programming contexts.</p>
          <h3><b>Tech Learning</b></h3>
          <p><b>RAD with Journey Apps</b><br />
            Experience the rush of Rapid Application Development using one of the best platforms for getting a product to market fast. Get familiar with data modeling and event handling.<br />
            <b>Nodebots</b><br />
            Bring code to life – apply your coding skills to programming arduinos, hookup some sensors, and get your system to tweet all about it.<br />
            <b>API</b><br />
            Now we know where data goes, how do we get it back? Set up an application programming interface so that your information is easy to consume without exposing your database.<br />
            <b>One Page App</b><br />
            You’ve got a lot to show. Don’t make your customers navigate a maze – keep content relevant combining all your skills with a bit of Ajax.<br />
            <b>Go Mobile</b><br />
            If you’re moving fast, why not put your application on any mobile? We’ll pick the best industry tool to allow anyone to use your app, whether on Android, iOS, or Windows.
          </p>
          <h3><strong>Agile Learning</strong></h3>
          <p><strong>Scrum 3</strong><br />
            Now start getting familiar with concepts like minimum viable product and trimming the backlog, using personas and prototypes to help with decision-making. See how retrospectives can help your team fly (or at least wade out of the swamp) and get familiar with creative thinking, developing ideas for your next challenge.
          </p>
          <h3><strong>Industry Orientation</strong></h3>
          <p><b>User Experience Design</b><br />
            Code something users actually want to use. UX workshops run by top experts take you from interviewing to user testing to paper prototyping.<br />
            <b>Entrepreneurship</b><br />
            At codeX, we support coders who want to use technology to solve problems they see in their communities. We have a regular roster of local entrepreneurs coming through to tell their stories, to inspire you to think about how to use the skills you’re learning at codeX to build businesses.

          <h1>Apply your learning</h1>
          <p>Now that you’ve had some exposure to the many things programmers do, you’ll know more about what you love doing.</p>
          <p>Repetition is core to learning, so now you get to apply your new skills on your own tightly time-boxed project, to reuse and focus your skills.</p>
          <p>Teams form around shared passions and complementary skills. Pick a <a href="#TechFocus">tech focus</a>, add some creative thinking to define your own short project.  Then build the bare bones to cement your learning foundations and clarify your next learning goals.</p>
          <p style="text-align:center;"><i>expected duration: 3-4 weeks</i></p>
          <h3>Tech Learning</h3>
          <p>Building your Definition of Done to maximize collaboration. Use TDD from start to end, giving you the freedom to refactor with confidence.
          <br>Apply version control from scratch, handle merge conflicts &amp; discover the whys and hows of code reviews &amp; committing frequently. Then let TravisCI show you where your build broke.</p>
          <h3>Agile Learning</h3>
          <p>Once again, tackle your tasks as a scrum team to share and deepen your knowledge (and speed up delivery too!)
          <br>Put your experience with prototypes into practice: build persona and their story map, and step through the interface flow with paper prototypes.
          <br>Now trim the backlog to the barest essence: the minimum viable product for your very short project.<br />
            <a name="TechFocus"></a>
          </p>
          <h2>Tech focus of choice</h2>
          <p>Here are some of the directions you could choose for your next few projects.</p>
          <p><b>Data</b>
          <br>Explore the way we use &amp; share information. Know when to use a relational or NoSQL database. Data gives us insight, but how do we make it meaningful? Know what to show, and make it interactive.</p>
          <p><b>Web Applications</b>
          <br>Collaboration is at the core of innovation. Develop a responsive website that allows real time collaboration across the continent (and just next door) and change how your community interacts.</p>
          <p><b>Mobile Apps</b>
          <br>Opportunities are everywhere – not just at our desks. Use a cross platform development tool to turn paper forms into a mobile app that goes wherever your customer goes.</p>
          <p><b>Robotics / Hardware</b>
          <br>Sense and respond to the world around you – or indulge in the only true multitasking: set your things to work for you. Hook up your arduino with some sensors, twinkle LEDs or get moving with servos.</p>

          <br><br>
          <h1>Release 3 – Exploration</h1>
          <p>Whether it’s the stories in data, fostering online collaboration or controlling moving cameras that fascinates you, in this release you’ll focus on an area you know you want to explore more.</p>
          <p>You could add to your existing product, step into a new problem domain, or if you’re really flying, try out a client project.</p>
          <p><i>expected duration: 6-8 weeks</i></p>
          <p><b>Agile Learning</b><br />
            You can test your code, but how do you know you’ve designed it right? We’ll discover how to validate assumptions with test scenarios that bring together personas, prototypes and user stories &#8211; giving you clarity before you even write a line of code. Keep your backlog up to date with all the changes along the way.
          </p>
          <p><b>Tech Learning</b><br />
            Experiment with branching strategies to reduce your team’s merge conflicts.<br />
            How fast can you test and deploy? Discover continuous integration and get your code onto Staging and Live environments.<br />
            Learning a new language will keep you sharp for coming projects too. Refactor to clean up as you discover more about the domain.
          </p>
          <h1>Release 4 – Experience</h1>
          <p>You understand code. You’ve deployed it, you’ve changed it, you’ve re-deployed it. You’ve handled the feedback from critical to quirky. Now apply your learning to an industry project, working with a client to help solve their problems.</p>
          <p><b>Agile Learning</b><br />
            Work on a scrum team with a product owner from a partner company. You’ll groom requirements together and test assumptions to make sure you’re building want the client needs &#8211; and their customers want.
          </p>
          <p><b>Tech Learning</b><br />
            Work within your client’s tech stack and end-to-end deployment processes.<br />
            Meet an existing codebase. Whoa there. There’s nothing like live code to help understand why it’s so important to follow good coding standards. It may be a whole new domain &#8211; what does the documentation tell you?
