## PARTNER UNDERSTANDING

codeX partners are organisations that need to grow their developer resource base. Partnership with code X is a deep and productive road. It starts with a sponsorship of one or more students in one of our academies and ends with hired staff as well as completed real world products.

### Seat sponsorship 
Partners sponsor a seat in the academy in return for a first opportunity to hire our students (not tied into a specific student). Sponsorships are R25,000 for 3 months per seat. We expect students to stay in codeX up to a year, but you only re-up if youâ€™re happy with our results.

### Project partner 
Partners supply product owners for a project aimed at their business needs; your own product owners guarantee a relevant outcome. Projects originate with the partner and are framed appropriately for the codeX educational model; projects are tagged to skills and a point system based on complexity and expertise acquired.

The billing model is on a contract basis at R150 per hour per codeX student (who work in teams). Scrum master and in-house educational support are supplied by codeX. We anticipate that there are 15 billable days of 6 hours each in a month available from a codeX student. The resulting products become the property of the project partner.

### Development methodologies
We base our development on strong agile principles. Expect test driven development, sprints, backlogs, product owners and all the other trappings that result in successful product development.
