          <p>Developers are in high demand and critically short supply. We train talented young brains to get these high paying jobs, and build Africa's digital future.</p>
          <p>We believe that technical skills can be learned, but self-motivated creative thinkers are born. If you believe you’ll always be learning and will stop at nothing to solve the problem at hand, 
          <a href="/content/apply.html">we want you</a>.</p>

          <p>Being a developer isn’t just about building technology; it’s about how you build technology. codeX follows agile philosophy and methodology. You’ll learn test-driven development and extreme programming, and have scrums every day. Don’t worry about the terms now. The point is to help you succeed in an environment where you know very little, which is how the real world works anyway.</p>

          <p>codeX is a full-time apprenticeship: 9 to 5, every weekday. You'll build real projects for real companies. You might even get paid for them as you grow your skills. codeX guides you and gives you a safe space to experiment and grow.</p>
          <p>But we only invest in people who invest in themselves.</p>
          <p>You need to show up every day on time, work well with your team members, and be focused on delivering what the client wants. There are no grades and no tests, but you’ll be evaluated continuously. If you don’t perform, you’ll be replaced.</p>
