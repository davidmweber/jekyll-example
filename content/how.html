						<p>Cost per seat is R9000 per month. Apprentices pay R1000 per month and the rest is sponsored by companies who want to hire you when you've gotten enough experience. As your projects get more sophisticated, if companies want the products you build for them, you'll get paid for them.</p>
						<p><b>Don’t not apply because of money</b>. We will find a way for the best talent to pay their way. But this is the real world, and there’s no free lunch.</p>

						<p>Every project you do is tagged to the skills you gain from it and points you earn in those skills. You build out your skills tree (which you’ll design yourself). Your skills tree is completely individual: you may have bigger branches in design and front-end coding, or back end programming and database management, or project management and product ownership.</p>
						<p>codeX hosts your portfolio and corresponding skills tree so employers know exactly what you’ve built, what your role was in the project, and how you were evaluated.</p>
