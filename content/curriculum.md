code X operates on core methodologies and principles which we believe foster great developers and help us build strong relationships with our industry partners:

 - Learning is a life-long process, so we teach people to learn for themselves.
 - Agile methodology is the best way to manage uncertainty and rapidly changing circumstances, both in actual programming and education.
 - Test driven development results in reliable systems that support big changes with minimal risks. It enables continuous integration and continuous product deployment.
 - Open source wherever possible. Software today is a give and take. Use it, change it, contribute back to the community.
 - Multiple everything. You need multiple skills. Multiple languages, databases, operating systems and software platforms.
