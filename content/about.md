## APPROACH

codeX is not just radical, it’s inside out and sometimes back to front. Learning is something you need to do for the rest of your life and we don’t think you can do that by sitting in a class. Today, knowledge can be grabbed as you need it. The real world throws novel problems at you every day and success depends on you experiencing these challenges as exciting opportunities to learn. Exams? Forget it. Will it be easy? Nope. Exciting? Definitely.

codeX is a working environment. You arrive on time in the morning and only go home when your work day is done.  You are assigned projects as a team. Projects get broken into tasks; the team executes those tasks. Unknowns are part of your day. If you need to learn a new programming language to complete a project, learning it will be one of the tasks.

You are continuously evaluated by your team members and the codeX team for what you deliver and how you conduct yourself. Performance counts. If you don’t perform, you can be asked to leave. We produce useful people. You take a strong CV with a tangible project portfolio to your first job.

You will learn real skills like data structures, programming languages, testing methodologies, deployment etc. We have a big set of these that you need to be able to do to get good evaluations. 

Projects are drawn from real world industry sources so they will be continuously changed and updated, but always carefully designed to be challenging, fun and educational. We practice test driven development under an agile process. Fit for the real world.

## COST

Quality education is never free, but there are many ways to pay. codeX is modular in its design; students pay by the month with an initial commitment of three months. If you get hired after three months, fantastic! If you want to build your portfolio and gain more skills and practical experience, stay for a year.

Students pay R1500 per month. Eventually you may make that back, and more, through your project work.

Partners sponsor the balance of the cost.

You’ll be building real products for real companies; if your work is excellent, companies will pay for what you’ve built. If you spend a month building a project your client buys, the client pays your fees for the next month.
