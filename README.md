# codeX Jekyll site sources

The  website is build using the [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) site generator and the [stability](http://themeforest.net/item/stability-responsive-html5css3-template/7222255) HTML template. Note that we have purchased a regular license for codeX. This approach allows fast and flexible changes to be made to the site by templating key aspects such as navigation, layouts and the like.

Building the website is as per the [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) documention. Deployment is automatic using [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/).
