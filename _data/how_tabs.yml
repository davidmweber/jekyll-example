    <p>Cost per seat is R9000 per month. Apprentices pay R1000 per month and the rest is 
    sponsored by companies who want to hire you when you've gotten enough experience. 
    As your projects get more sophisticated, if companies want the products you build for 
    them, you'll get paid for them.</p>
    <p><b>Don’t not apply because of money</b>. We will find a way for the best 
    talent to pay their way. But this is the real world, and there’s no free lunch.</p>

    <p>Give us a project and a product owner from your staff to work with the apprentices 
    a few hours per week, so they build what you need, to your exact specifications. If 
    you like the product, buy it at steeply discounted rates.</p>

    <p>Every project you do is tagged to the skills you gain from it and points you earn
    in those skills. You build out your skills tree (which you’ll design yourself). 
    Your skills tree is completely individual: you may have bigger branches in design and 
    front-end coding, or back end programming and database management, or project management 
    and product ownership.</p>
    <p>codeX hosts your portfolio and corresponding skills tree so employers know exactly 
    what you’ve built, what your role was in the project, and how you were evaluated.</p>
