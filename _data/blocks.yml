    <h4 class="block-hd">GROWING AFRICAN DEVELOPERS.</h4>
    <p>Programmers are in high demand and critically short supply. We train talented young brains to get these high paying jobs, and build Africa's digital future.<br>
    We believe technical skills can be learned, but self-motivated thinkers are born. If you believe you’ll always be learning and will stop at nothing to solve the problem at hand, we want you.<p>

    <h4 class="block-hd">WHAT WE’RE NOT -  SCHOOL.</h4> 
    <p>codeX is a full-time apprenticeship 9 to 5, every weekday. Very quickly, you'll build real projects for real companies. You might even get paid for them as you grow your skills, and commit to working for our partners for a time at the end (if they want to hire you). codeX guides you and gives you a safe space to experiment and grow.<br><br>
    There are no formal classes, though you’ll learn industry standard programming languages like Java, PHP, Python, and Javascript. In order to build your projects, you'll be guided through online content with a developer mentor always available to help.<br><br>
    codeX complements the learn-by-doing approach with daily coding exercises (katas) and talks with industry professionals and mentors so you gain context for your programming knowledge in computer science and business.<br><br>
    But we only invest in people who invest in themselves.<br><br>
    You need to show up every day on time, work well with your team members, and be focused on delivering what the client wants. There are no grades and no tests, but you’ll be evaluated continuously. If you don’t perform, you’ll be replaced.</p>

    <h4 class="block-hd">AGILE IS THE WAY</h4>
    <p>Being a developer isn’t just about knowing certain computer languages; it’s about learning how to figure out what works and moving the ball forward. In codeX, you’ll learn agile philosophy and methods like test-driven development, extreme programming, and daily scrums.<br><br>

    Don’t worry about the terms now. The point is we arm you with the tools to succeed in an environment where you know very little, which is how the real world works.</p>

    <h4 class="block-hd">BUILDING OUR DIGITAL ECONOMY</h4>
    <p>Africa has the world’s fastest growing economies and youngest population, nearly all of whom connect with the world on mobile phones. In the next decade, the hundreds of millions of Africans who aren’t
    online already will be. Thousands and thousands of jobs will be created to meet the demands of a billion person digital economy across 54 countries. Many of those jobs are already here.<br><br>
    In our varied backgrounds across media, finance, engineering, and software development, the codeX team constantly meets companies struggling to fill their growing ranks with highly skilled creative 
    developers. They are often forced to outsource these jobs elsewhere. On the other side, we know untold thousands of young, smart, digitally savvy Africans don’t have access to the education needed to get
    these high paying jobs and build careers powering Africa’s growth.<br><br>
    The tech world needs a powerful but efficient way to bring more people in. codeX supports teams of apprentices working with real companies and not just students in a classroom, because you’re learning the
    skills the job market wants in real time, and meeting the people who will hire you long before you go to an interview. At the same time, you have a safe space to experiment, take risks, and explore your own
    talents so you will be ready to take on that great job, or even build your own company.<br><br>
    Africa will play a much bigger role in the global economy in the years to come. Sure, it has resources the world needs, but its biggest assets are its peoples' creativity, ingenuity, and determination. The
    mission of codeX is to arm you with the skills you need to take all that talent and create the future.</p>

    <h4 class="block-hd">Costs</h4>
    <p>Cost per seat is R29,500 per term. Apprentices are expected to pay R4,500 of the fee
    the rest is sponsored by companies who want to hire you when you've gotten enough 
    experience. As your projects get more sophisticated, if companies want the products 
    you build for them, you'll get paid for them.
    <br>
    <br><b>Don’t not apply because of money</b>. We will find a way for the best 
    talent to pay their way. But this is the real world, and there’s no free lunch.</p>
     <h4 class="block-hd">Build your CV</h4>
      <p>Every project you do is tagged to the skills you gain from it and points you earn
    in those skills. You build out your skills tree (which you’ll design yourself). 
    Your skills tree is completely individual: you may have bigger branches in design and 
    front-end coding, or back end programming and database management, or project management 
    and product ownership.
    <br>
    <br>codeX hosts your portfolio and corresponding skills tree so employers know exactly 
    what you’ve built, what your role was in the project, and how you were evaluated.</p>
