  content: |
    <p>Developers are in high demand and critically short supply. We train talented young 
    brains to get these high paying jobs, and build Africa's digital future.</p>
    <p>We believe that technical skills can be learned, but self-motivated creative 
    thinkers are born. If you believe you’ll always be learning and will stop at nothing 
    to solve the problem at hand, <a href="/content/apply.html">we want you</a>.</p>
- label: Agile is the way
  content: |
    <p>Being a developer isn’t just about building technology; it’s about how you build 
    technology. codeX follows agile philosophy and methodology. You’ll learn 
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development">test-driven 
    development</a> and <a href="http://www.extremeprogramming.org/">extreme programming</a>, 
    and have <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(software_development)">scrums</a>
    every day. Don’t worry about the terms now. The point is to help you succeed in an 
    environment where you know very little, which is how the real world works anyway.</p>
- label: "What codeX isn’t: school"
  content: |
    <p>codeX is a full-time apprenticeship: 9 to 5, every weekday. You'll build real 
    projects for real companies. You might even get paid for them as you grow your skills. 
    codeX guides you and gives you a safe space to experiment and grow.</p> 
    <p>There are no formal classes and no prescribed languages, though you’ll 
    learn several and plenty of hard coding skills. You’ll learn by working through 
    big questions and breaking them down into solvable problems with your team and us.</p> 
    <p>codeX complements the learn by doing approach with daily coding exercises (katas) 
    and talks with industry professionals and mentors so you gain context for your programming 
    knowledge in computer science and in business.</p>
    <p>But we only invest in people who invest in themselves.</p>
    <p>You need to show up every day on time, work well with your team members, and be focused 
    on delivering what the client wants. There are no grades and no tests, but you’ll be 
    evaluated continuously. If you don’t perform, you’ll be replaced.</p>
