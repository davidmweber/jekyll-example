    The cheapest way to groom and hire talent. Get first crack at hiring them after you've worked with them on a project, 
    instead of committing to a contract without knowing what they can do. 
    <p>Sponsored coders commit to working for one of codeX's sponsor companies at market rate for the same amount of time 
    they are sponsored, i.e. if they spend 3 terms in codeX, they agree to work for 9 months. Jobs are not tied to specific sponsors and are not guaranteed, but our sponsor companies get the first opportunity to hire our graduates.</p>

  content: Give us a project and a product owner from your staff to work with the coders a few hours per week, so they build what you need, to your exact specifications. If you like the product, buy it at steeply discounted rates.
