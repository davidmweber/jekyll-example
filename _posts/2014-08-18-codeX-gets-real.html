    <p><a href="http://projectcodex.co">codeX</a> is a startup. For the last several months, <a href="http://www.projectcodex.co/content/about.html">our team</a> has been working to do all the things new companies need to do to get up and running, engage with our <a href="http://www.projectcodex.co/content/partners.html">partners and sponsors</a>, and recruit the best young minds for <a href="http://www.projectcodex.co/content/curriculum.html">our developer apprenticeship program</a>. But until now, it’s still existed mainly as an idea.</p>
    <p><a href="https://twitter.com/project_codeX">codeX</a> became real on Saturday, when we ran a daylong workshop, codeX<a href="http://tedxcapetown.org/tedxcapetown-2014">@TEDx</a>, kindly sponsored by our friends at <a href="http://get.mxit.com/">Mxit</a>.</p>
    <p> We invited some of our top applicants as well as potential future codeXers from <a href="http://www.rlabs.org/">RLabs</a> in Athlone and <a href="http://www.silulo.co.za/">Silulo Ulutho</a> in Khayelitsha to come and see what codeX is about. Since we start our training assuming no programming knowledge, there was no coding at all in our “hackathon.”</p>

    <p>Instead, our COO <a href="https://twitter.com/Cara_Faye">Cara Turner</a> got our participants to sort themselves into teams and explained how they would design and build bridges out of popsicle sticks, rubber bands, binder clips, and glue. </p>

    <p><a href="https://twitter.com/veryflatcat">Dave</a> gave the specifications, which were that the bridge had to hold a kilo and span 30&#160;cm. That was pretty much all the direction the teams got; it was on them to work together to design and build the bridge. </p>

    <p>It wasn’t easy, but I was amazed at how everyone just dove right into the challenge, working seamlessly with people they’d never met to do something they’d never done before.</p>

    <p>After about half an hour, each group was called over to our <a href="http://rethinkeducation.co.za/">ReThink Education</a> table, to do a few maths exercises on the system with CEO <a href="https://twitter.com/doughoernle">Doug Hoernle</a>. </p>

    <p>After lunch <a href="https://twitter.com/avermeulen">Andre Vermeulen</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/njacobs5074">Nick Jacobs</a> demo’ed the hardware side of codeX. It was pretty clear they were into it; Andre and Nick got bombarded by a ton of questions on what could be done with them.</p>

    <p>Next, Cara took the teams through TinkerSpace, where everyone reflects on what they learned and what they would have liked to be better. This is where everyone becomes conscious of how the whole project went for themselves, the team, and more broadly, so that it can constantly be improved.</p>

    <p>This is part of what sets codeX apart from your average coding academy. We’re not just teaching people how to code, though of course that’s the central purpose. We’re teaching people how to be thoughtful creators who see continuously learning as the essence of their job. </p>

    <p>During TinkerSpace, it was crucial for the teams to chat among themselves. In fact, Cara shooed me away when she caught me asking too many questions to a group (it is my nature as a journalist, after all!) and I was glad she did. The responses on sticky notes spoke for themselves—it’s empowering to be asked to analyze what happened, and it makes sure everyone’s thoughts are accounted for. </p>
    <p>After that, we interviewed some of the applicants who’d already submitted their applications for this term and next. The diversity of where people come from, how they’d learned about codeX, why they want to do become developers, is amazing. I can’t wait to see what they build together.</p>

    <p>What they all have in common is that no one has waited for anyone else’s blessing or instruction to make things for themselves. They all show a clear internal motivation to create. That’s what we’re looking for, so if you think you have it, <a href="http://www.projectcodex.co/content/apply.html">apply!</a></p>
