<h2> codeX in the news </h2>
codeX is getting some exposure on eNCA's "The Tech Report" this week. The episode is really about the NXTGen Coders Conference that was in Oct 2014 - I did a presentation there, but the codeX coders is featuring in there as well. I will get a youtube link for it soon. In the mean time if you have DSTV here is the details. See it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/encaTechReport">YouTube!</a>
