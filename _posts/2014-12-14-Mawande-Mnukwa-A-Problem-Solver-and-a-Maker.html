    <p>Mawande Mnukwa</p>
</div>
<p>Mawanda Mnukwa is 24 years old and comes from Langa. He loves to learn and loves to build things.</p>
<p>“When I was young, I was always the one in the family who would figure out what’s wrong with the radio, the TV, the kettle.”</p>

<p>Mawanda took maths and science for matric, “But I can honestly say I have only really enjoyed maths after matric. When I code, I see why I am doing something from a maths point of view”.</p>

<p>This is his advice if you’re not sure if you have what it takes to be a coder:
<ul class="fa-ul">
  <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-lightbulb-o"></i>Are you always curious and always wanting to know more?</li>
  <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-lightbulb-o"></i>Are you always problem-solving in your environment, not just seeing lots of problems, but working out how to solve them?</li>
  <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-lightbulb-o"></i>Are you always twisting things this way and that, finding solutions?</li>
  <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-lightbulb-o"></i>Apart from always being curious, do you also enjoy working in a team?</li>
</ul>
If this is you, Mawande believes you can become a coder.</p>

<p>His advice to anyone interested in doing this course is:

<ul class="fa-ul">
  <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-lightbulb-o"></i>If you love being challenged, even when you don’t know how to do something, then you will be a good coder;</li>
  <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-lightbulb-o"></i>If you are someone who is always fixing things in the house, if you like taking things apart, finding out HOW things work, then you’ll love coding;</li>
  <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-lightbulb-o"></i>If you like finding your  own way of doing things, of taking the knowledge you have and applying it in different ways, then coding could be the career for you;</li>
</ul></p>

<p>Mawande is excited about all he has learned at CodeX:
<br>
<i>"The best things I have gotten from the course is learning new computer languages, and discovering that the things I have always wanted to do, I can now do.
Currently, I am learning about programming robots. I even tried using Arduino to make a coffee machine that switches itself on when sunlight falls on it in the morning.</i>i></p>

</div>

<p>To prospective codeX coders, Mawande has this to say:<br><br>

<i>“With any new skill you must work very, very hard to learn it, and then you must keep at it. But the knowledge is out there. You must simply go out and do the work. I am loving codeX because the opportunities and the possibilities of what I can now do seem endless, and I love being exposed to all these new opportunities.”</i></p>
