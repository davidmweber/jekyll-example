<h2>Free access to internet and mentors to learn coding basics</h2>
<p>At codeX, we are hunting for the best raw talent to grow into the next generation of African coders, <i>no matter where they come from</i>.</p>

<p>We’ve made online <a href="http://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/web" target="_blank">Codecademy</a> courses in programming basics prerequisites for getting into the 2015 year-long apprenticeship program for two reasons:
<ul  class="fa-ul">
<li><i class="fa-li fa fa-lightbulb-o"></i>People can see whether coding is really for them before committing the time and resources that codeX requires</li>
<li><i class="fa-li fa fa-lightbulb-o"></i>Everyone, no matter where they come from, will arrive on the first day (Feb 16, 2015) with some very basic understanding of coding concepts.</li>
</ul></p>
<p>While these online courses are free, the reality of our country is that only <a href="http://www.htxt.co.za/2014/06/18/only-10-of-south-africa-has-internet-at-home/" target="_blank">10% of South Africans have Internet at home</a>, so many potentially awesome coders don't have the opportunity to show what they can do.</p>

<p><b>We want to make sure anyone who doesn’t have regular access to the internet still has the chance to learn to code.</b></p>

<h3>Open Days:</h3> 
<p>That’s why we are partnering with the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/centrallibrarycapetown" target="_blank">Central Library</a> in Cape Town, <a href="http://www.brothersforall.org/magic-and-miracles/" target="_blank">Brothers</a> for All in Langa, and <a href="http://www.kuyasa-empowerment.org/" target="_blank">Kuyasa</a> in Kayamandi (Stellenbosch) to provide free internet access for aspiring coders to work through the courses.
We know sometimes access alone isn’t enough, so every Open Day session and site will have mentors from the local tech community to help people get going and answer questions.</p>

<h3>Are you an aspiring coder?</h3>
<p>If you need internet access, sign up <a href="http://opendays.projectcodex.co/" target="_blank">here</a> for the venue and times you’re available. If you start working through the courses and want to <a href="http://www.projectcodex.co/content/apply.html" target="_blank">apply to codeX</a>, we’ll be on hand to help you do that as well!</p>
<h3>Are you a developer or web designer?</h3> 
<p>Spend a Saturday morning or afternoon mentoring.
If you want to help create a vibrant and diverse tech industry, please <a href="http://opendays.projectcodex.co/" target="_blank">sign up!</a>
You don’t have to be an expert to mentor - you just need patience and sufficient understanding of the basics of coding to help brand-newbies as they step through the concepts.</p>

<h3>How does it work?</h3>
<p>Each venue has a limited number of slots available for applicants and mentors on Saturdays from now to end of January, in morning and afternoon sessions.
A codeX representative will be there to make sure that everything is running smoothly. We’ll manage the registrations and confirm attendance for each venue.
Here’s the list of times and total seats at each venue.</p>
