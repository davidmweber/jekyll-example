<p><span><strong>Want a job in tech but don't have training?</strong> </span> 
<br><img src="/images/codeX2TeamCoding.png" alt="teams" align="right"  style="margin:5px;">Programmers are in high demand and critically short supply. codeX is a brand new program training talented young brains to get these high paying jobs, and build Africa's digital future.</p>
Technical skills can be learned, you just need to be a self-motivated thinker. If you believe you’ll always be learning and will stop at nothing to solve the problem at hand, we want you.&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>How does it work?</b>
<br>codeX is a full-time apprenticeship 9 to 5, every weekday. Very quickly, you'll build real projects for real companies. codeX guides you and gives you a safe space to experiment and grow. The first term runs full time from 15 September to 12 December 2014.
<p><strong>Sponsorships</strong>
<br>The cost is R25 000 per three month term. We also have sponsorships available for deserving applicants (so show us what you can do)!
<p><b>How do you apply?</b>
<br>Complete our <a href="http://www.projectcodex.co/content/apply.html?SC" target="_self">online form</a> with your details, something you’ve made (anything - it doesn’t need to be code!) and some interesting puzzles.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then join <b>codeX at TEDx</b>
<br>We want to get to know you and see what you can do in person.&nbsp;
<br>Top applicants will be invited to our "hackathon" at Cape Town's TEDx conference on <b>Saturday 16 August</b>, from 11:00 am - 3:00pm.&nbsp;
<br>You'll work on teams to build projects (no tech skills needed!), just like you'll be doing every day if you get into codeX.</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">All qualifying applicants will also be able to attend <a href="http://tedxcapetown.org/tedxcapetown-2014" target="_blank">TEDx talks</a> <span style="color: #000000;">in the opening and closing session free of charge!</span></p>
