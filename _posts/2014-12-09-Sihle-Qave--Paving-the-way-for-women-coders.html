    <p>Sihle on her first day</p>
</div>
<p>Sihle is the only woman in the codeX class of 2014. She is affectionately called “the geek” by the team, and considers this a great compliment. But more importantly, she is the person who helps keep the team grounded.</p>
<p>Sihle’s love of technology first emerged after she did PC Tech course at Silulo Ulutho in Khayelitsha. It was after this first exposure that she realised she loves the challenge of coding, and is in fact really good at it.</p>

<p>Now, she looks forward to hearing from her codeX mentors about the new projects she has been tasked to build. She loves researching solutions online and then sharing the information she finds with her team. Even at home, she keeps herself busy fixing PCs and cabling for her friends and family. In fact, she’s the first one to admit that she loves wiring.</p>

</div>


<p>She avidly believes that technology is a wide open field for women and says:<br>
“I have a passion for technology. Guys aren’t better at technology. To do well, you just have to be your own person.”<br>
“I am so excited about everything. I love studying how to make a blog, how to create a web-site, everything. I love starting something from scratch.”<br></p>

<p>She does admit however that the first time you have to make something from scratch, it is very scary, “You worry about messing up, but I have now gotten used to it, and every day I am learning something new”.</p>

<p>“Right now, we are busy with electronics. I am making a robot car that will go and then stop. It must follow a line, and then stop and turn. But it needs to use lights to indicate which way it will turn. I have finished building the physical car, and am busy with creating the code for it. And I have done all of this in only two months!”</p>

<p>Sihle’s message to the women out there who are looking to build a new career in one of the most sought after professions in South Africa is: “if you have a love for technology, and are passionate about coding, then you must not feel intimidated. Anyone can learn how to code, especially since we have such good mentors at codeX”.</p>
