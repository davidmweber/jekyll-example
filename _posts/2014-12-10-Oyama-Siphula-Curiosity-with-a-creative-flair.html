<p>Oyama lives in Mbekweni in Chris Hani location, Paarl. His mother died when he was young and he and his brother were looked after by their grandmother, who inspired him to study science at school, since that was what his mother was going to study.</p>

<p>“I was always interested in technology, and creating computer programs to solve people’s problems, I love to help people with problems.”</p>

<p>“I first worked with a computer when my grandmother bought me one. I experienced a lot of problems with it thanks to my curiosity. I like to experiment with things, assuming that everything will be easy. Sometimes it’s not!”</p>

<p>“A friend inspired me to learn more about software and hardware. He told me that the more I experience problems, the more knowledge I would gain by working them out.”</p>

<p>I now see myself as a professional in software development, thanks to codeX.</p>

<p>I love the connections I am making at codeX, meeting people who are working in different companies.
There are lots of challenges, but in order for us to overcome them we must focus, check on the Internet, and do our research.
As part of his application to become a codeX coder, Oyama shared a picture of a small lighting bulb he had created:</p>

<p>“It was really an art skill that I shared, but I have always been creative. I love problem solving and my ability to solve problems has improved, thanks to the codeX course.”</p>

<p>“My favourite quote is by Albert Einstein: ‘The only source of knowledge is experience’. If I compare and contrast what I knew when I came in and how I am doing now, I’ve moved really far. It’s been so exciting and I am looking forward to the rest of the course.”</p>
