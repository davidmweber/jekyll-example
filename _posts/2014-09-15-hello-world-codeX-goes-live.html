<p>Today was a big day in a whole bunch of lives. </p>
<p>For me, it marked the first sprout from the seed I planted a year ago, when I left my life in New York City and moved back to South Africa with an idea of something I might be able to help grow. </p>

<p>For our team at codeX, it was the realization of months of dreaming, debating, planning, and straight up work.  After all my years covering startups, I only now know what it’s like to actually be one. How miraculous it is that a unique combination of people can come together to build something out of nothing. </p>

<p>But I am, as my editor might say, burying the lead. This story is about the 12 awesome people who’ve found their way into the first group of codeX coders, who they are training themselves to be and what they are going to build.</p>

<p>They came to us from all different places and circumstances, but there’s no question the 12 we picked out of more than 800 applicants are the kind of self-motivated, determined problem solvers the world needs.</p>

<p>They have talents and skills we’ve just begun to discover, and they themselves have just begun to tap. But it’s all right there in the lights of their eyes. </p>

<p>We’ve got computers and phones, t-shirts and pens, awesome sponsors and challenging projects. </p>

<p>Now we plow ahead with a programme different from every other coding academy I’ve seen &#8212; in that it puts the responsibility of learning on the learner. </p>

<p>No lectures, no tests, and no piece of paper at the end. Instead, they do real projects with real companies, continuously evaluate themselves and their teams, and a build a completely individualized knowledge tree linking to all the projects, media, and code associated with the concepts and skills they master.</p>

<p>You’ll be hearing from the coders themselves soon enough, they have their own stories to tell and all I can do is make sure they have every tool they need to tell them. </p>

<p>Good storytellers, great coders. We know this continent needs them. We know the talent is here. </p>

<p>We are growing agile developers, and codeX eats its own dog food. The only thing we’re sure of is we’re going to have all our assumptions tested, and we’ll be adjusting every step of the way.</p>

<p>Whatever happens, nothing could be more thrilling than actually doing this. Howzit world, codeX is live.</p>
