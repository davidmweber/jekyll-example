<h2>Do you want to become a codeX coder?</h2>
<h4>Do you want real-life skills for a real-life job?</h4>
<h4>Do you have what it takes to “Learn how to learn”?</h4>
<h4>Have you thought of enrolling for codeX and making 2015 the year you learn to code?</h4>

 <a href="https://href.li/?http://www.projectcodex.co/content/apply.html">Apply now for our next programme in February 2015</a>

<p>What is the ‘X-factor’ that the codeX team is looking for?<p>

<p>A codeX coder needs determination, tenacity and grit, high levels of motivation and drive and a constant desire to learn more</p>
</p>We are looking for people who want to make things. That’s why when you apply
to join codeX, we ask you to show us something you’ve already made.</p>

<p>If you go to the <a href="https://href.li/?http://www.projectcodex.co/content/apply.html">application form</a> you will see a question which asks you to:
“Tell us about something you’ve made, or something you’ve done to solve a
problem. It need not have anything to do with technology. Anything you’ve done
that shows your motivation. Why did you do it, what did it mean for you”.</p>

<p>So at codeX we’re looking for people with a very special set of attributes:</p> 

<ul class="fa-ul">
  <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-lightbulb-o"></i>Do you have a problem-solving gene?</li> 
  <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-lightbulb-o"></i>Do you keep trying to find an answer to things, or keep on twisting a problem around until you find a way through it?</li>
  <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-lightbulb-o"></i>Are you creative?</li> 
  <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-lightbulb-o"></i>Do you think outside the box, bring a range of ideas from various experiences and different walks of life?</li>  
  <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-lightbulb-o"></i>Do you think logically?</li> 
  <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-lightbulb-o"></i> Can you take information from various sources and turn it into something that’s
structured, in a way that a computer can understand it?</li>
  <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-lightbulb-o"></i>Do you have empathy for people?</li> 
  <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-lightbulb-o"></i>Can you imagine yourself in somebody else’s shoes, can you imagine
what the end user of software needs and wants?</li>
  <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-lightbulb-o"></i> Are you good at getting to the
essence of a problem and finding ways to solve it? At codeX we work on real
world projects for real businesses.</li>
<li><i class="fa-li fa fa-lightbulb-o"></i>Do you work well in a team? Team-work is
such an important part of coding.</li>
<li><i class="fa-li fa fa-lightbulb-o"></i>Are you flexible? Are you eager to learn
how to learn? We are not looking for ‘experts’, if you are already an expert
coder, you should be out there coding already.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>But if you fit the bill, and have that elusive “X Factor” we’re looking for, we have one last question for you:</b></p>

<div class="text_center">
“We’re building stuff for the real world in Africa. 
Why don’t you come join us?”
