    <p>Sanele Qumba</p>
</div>
<p>Sanele Qumba is originally from Butterworth in the Eastern Cape and studied at the Cape Peninsular 
University of Technology before coming to CodeX via participating in a day -long workshop, or really hackathon, codeX@TEDx, kindly sponsored by Mxit.</p>
<p>The workshop included top applicants who had come to the website through sponsored posts on social media, but also included potential coders from RLabs in Athlone and Silulo Ulutho in Khayelitsha to come and see what codeX is about. Since codeX assumes no programming knowledge, there was no coding at all in the hackathon; instead, Cara Turner, the COO of codeX asked teams of people to build bridges out of a variety of materials.</p>

<p>Sanele was chosen as a result of his participation that day and has found his two months in CodeX to be extremely exciting, and he especially relishes the fact that you put all your projects up online on GitHub. He finds that not only is it very interesting to see other people’s work, as well as your own, and that this alone gives him ideas, but that, in fact, when he views his work he finds he comes up with even more ideas of what to do, what to do differently, and what else to do. He finds that this permanent records is of real help and benefit to him and really helps to embed the learning fully. Of course, having the code readily available to view on GitHub is also of immense value and use to recruiters who, research indicates, are more interested in what coders can do than in the qualifications they bring to the table.</p>

<p>He says it has been extremely challenging in that everything he is doing, he is doing for the very first time. He says some aspects, like networking, he knew how to do, but to write code from scratch has been extremely challenging, particularly since he did not do maths at High School. However, with perseverance, he finds he is overcoming this, and many other challenges.</p>

<p>Every project is different, and Sanele finds he he has to do lots of extra research to keep pace, but, at the same hand, although he has had to come to grips with the basics of maths, it’s dealing with the coding that is what stretches him, and the focus on thinking out-of-the-box. At the same time, when he looks back, all he can see is how much he has improved and how success builds upon success.</p>

<p>His advice to any would-be student thinking of coming to codeX is to tell them simply to allow yourself to embrace failure, and, even when you fail, to know that you are learning – as much as you are failing, you are getting somewhere. If you don’t even try anything, you don’t even fail, but if you fail, you learn to learn and finally you will succeed.</p>

<p>His other advice is simply to be determined and committed and be willing to do research. Team-work he has found works perfectly for him, and that codeX allows for people within each team to work at their own pace, but that the real-world projects undertaken have enabled him to develop both individually and as a valued member of a cohesive and hard-working team. This approach is deliberate, and goes with the agile coaching that the mentors nurture at codeX. Agile methodology is about implementing a form of learning based on the theory of deliberate discovery, where the primary skill they nurture is discovery and learning since the data from the field clearly indicates that, more than anything else, a strong software team has the ability to learn.</p>

<p>The codeX motto is, in fact: <b>Learn how to learn</b>.</p>

<p>Currently, the learning Sanele is involved with is working with Lindani Pani from Khayelitsha on a mobile application to solve problems in the taxi industry. Sanele undertook original research both with taxi drivers, owners and members of the Taxi Association before they began to plan out how the app would work, since you need to know what problem you will solve before you initiate your design. Neither Sanele or Lindani are able to go into too much detail about the product they are in the process of developing since, as entrerpreneurs, there’s a limit to how much information they can give out on an app that they’d like to monetise, but certainly they see exciting days ahead – and all thanks to only two months of learning how to learn and especially how to code at codeX.</p>
