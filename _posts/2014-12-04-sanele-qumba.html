<p>Sanele Qumba is from Butterworth in the Eastern Cape and he studied at the Cape Peninsula University of Technology. He was invited to be a codeX coder after attending the codeX@TEDx hackathon sponsored by Mxit. Most people who attended the codeX@TEDx hackathon came from RLabs in Athlone and Silulo Ulutho in Khayelitsha, but the hackathon also included top applicants who found out about codeX through social media. At the hackathon Cara Turner, codeX’s COO, asked everyone to build bridges out of rubber bands and lollipop sticks. This was to see how creative people could be, since we don’t expect you to know how to program before you come to codeX.</p>

<p>Sanele was chosen for the codeX program and is very excited by all he has learned. He loves the fact that all his projects are now online at GitHub. “It’s very interesting to see other people’s work, as well as your own. Seeing this up there gives me ideas, every time I look at my code, I come up with more ideas of what to do and what I would do differently.” Of course, having the code online helps to reinforce Sanele’s learning. It also means he now has a portfolio of work to show recruiters. Research shows that recruiters are more interested in what coders can do than in the qualifications they have. Putting code online also helps to attract investors, as one of codeX’s key focus areas is on developing tech entrepreneurs in Africa, for Africa. Sanele says, “codeX has been extremely challenging because everything I am doing, I am doing for the first time. I found writing code from scratch to be very challenging, since I did not do maths at High School. But, with perseverance, I can overcome this, and many other challenges”. “Every project is different. I have to do lots of extra research to keep pace. It’s the coding that really stretches me, and the focus on thinking out-of-the-box. But when I look back, I see how much I have improved and this success builds upon success”. He has some advice for those who are thinking of becoming codeX coders. “Allow yourselves to embrace failure. Because even when you fail, you are learning, you are getting somewhere. If you don’t try anything, you won’t ever fail. But if you allow yourself to fail, you will learn how to learn and you will finally succeed”. “Do be determined and committed and willing to do research. I love the team-work and the focus on real-world projects. I can develop individually, at my own pace, but also as a valued member of a cohesive and hard-working team.” Sanele is busy working on a project with Lindani Pani, also from from Khayelitsha. They are developing a mobile application to solve some very real problems in the taxi industry. Sanele did some initial research with taxi drivers and owners and with this information they have designed an app that they hope to sell to members of the Taxi Association. They see exciting days ahead – and it’s all thanks to learning how to code at codeX.</p>
